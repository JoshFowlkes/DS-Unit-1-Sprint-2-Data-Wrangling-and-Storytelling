# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?
Stock Market and Option Trading

What do you know about?
4+ years of option trading experience. 

What decisions do you face?
When it comes to this project, whilst Im confident I could come to solid conclusions about the stock market based on data, the inherent difficulty in predicting moves adds a degree of credibility as well as complexity. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation
Would definitely stick with US based markets. 

2. Trend related to the news
The very nature of the stock market and how it fluctuates is based on news, so this topic wouldn't be lacking in this department. 

3. Who does that?
Mostly rich retired people that have plenty of money to blow, and degenerate gamblers.

4. Answering a question people care about
Who Doesn't want to get accurate stock market information that could make them money? A way to make someone more money is something that is always in demand. 

5. Valuable to businesses
The exciting aspect about using this topic as my project is that big banks such at Goldman or JPMorgan could see a good prospect when it comes to hiring. 

6. What's the most popular?
Within the stock world, theres always a handful of the most popular stocks. And this occurs on multiple time frames ie, one week, one month, even up to half a century when it comes to long term value investing and what's most popular in that arena. 

7. Cost/Money rankings
From an investment banking side, they're always looking for an edge, and by providing an edge that'll save them/make them money across the board.

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?
There's so many it's hard to even know where to begin. I'd say, the biggest misconception is how massively people underestimate the role that human anture plays in the market and in one's own personal investing. 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?
I was struck by the net neutrality one we went over in class. I like the idea of coming to some conclusion that's supported by evidence that shocks the current in place way of looking at things. 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?
Certainly, the market is so multi faceted and in constant flux that it's definitely possible. 

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?
Defintely, there's no shortage of content in this arena. 

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?
I don't see why not, any skill based activity could be used with this "style."

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?
I've already found a nice one on Kaggle, still debating if I'd want to use it though. 

# Assignment!

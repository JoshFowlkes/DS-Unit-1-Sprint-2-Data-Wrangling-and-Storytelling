# Ideas for data storytelling

## You

What do you care about?

Great Animated Shows like Rick & morty, DBZ, and One Punch Man. 

What do you know about?

All of the above mentioned shows I've not only seen every episode many times, but I've also gone deeper into the philsophies and underlying premises of each. Plus gone to depths of exploring each character of interest to get a full understanding of them. 

What decisions do you face?

For this one, I've found some nice data sets on the first two, not so much the third one. 

## Seven templates

Training Kit (https://learn.lambdaschool.com/ds/module/recedjanlbpqxic2r) explains the seven templates from Priceonomics.

Can you apply the templates to your topics? 

1. Geographic Variation

These are all shown in a handful of countries so would definitely stick to US as well as the original country it was made in if it's not US made.  

2. Trend related to the news

Rick & Morty as well as OPM are in the news since they are either in current seasons or new ones starting soon. Dragon ball not as much for the news category.  

3. Who does that?

Each of these have very devoted communites on Youtube as well as Reddit(the two main ones I know of) as well as wikis and things of the like, and when I say devoted communites, I really mean that they're SERIOUSLY devoted lol. 

4. Answering a question people care about

Each of these shows do spark debates of hypotheticals as well as character motives, future predictors and things of the like, all of which could be plotted out with data. 

5. Valuable to businesses

Not so much value to business here. With the exception being if I wanted to go get hired at either a studio or perhaps a video game company like Rockstar upon graduation. 

6. What's the most popular?

Within their own communites, much popularity debates and divisions take place. 

7. Cost/Money rankings

Can't see this topic being real big in the cost cutting arena. 

## Misconceptions

What misconceptions do people have about your topic?

Each of these shows produce an emotioal frenzy in the engaged fan, and thus spur on debates with opinions that may not be all that well substantiated with logic or reason lol, and thus with DS I could actually go and provide solid evidentiary support for a hypothesis(Haven't arrived at one yet.) 

## Examples

What data storytelling example inspires you?

I've been looking at the Rick & Morty API data set since the stretch goal in week one, then today seeing the Simpsons example during lecture increased my interest in this topic even further. 

Could you do a new hypothesis, for the same question?

Certainly, any hypothesis made is based only on whats been shown in the show so far, so its always suseptible to change.  

Could you do a new question, for the same topic?

Defintey, I have a lot of interest in these shows so I could take questions in all sorts of directions.  

Could you do a new topic, with the same "style"?

For sure, I'd have two more shows to use this "style" on. 

## Data

Where could you search for data about your topic?

I found a nice DBZ one on Kaggle, theres the Rick & Morty API, However I've struggled with finding OPM data. 

# Assignment!

Fill out the above template *twice*, for two different ideas.

Then compare and contrast and select one as the idea you're leaning towards
working on for your project week.
